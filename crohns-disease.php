					Crohn’s Disease:
				</h2>
				<h4>Seeking Treatment:</h4>
				<p>If you live in the Orlando area and are looking for a new Orlando gastroenterology doctor, you might be looking for one who is able to specialize in Crohn’s Disease. It might be something that you have recently learned you suffer from and are looking for ways to treat it or it could be something that you have had your entire life and are looking for new and updated treatment options. Here are some things that you may have never known or some information that you might find helpful. The first step you should take to treat your Crohn’s disease is to learn as much as you can about it.</p>

				<p><strong>Someone who suffers from Crohn’s disease has a chronic condition of the bowel that affects the lining of the digestive tract.</strong> When you have a problem related to Crohn’s disease, you will experience a flare up which can lead to emergency room visits and unexpected problems. The exact reason why someone has this problem has yet to be learned, however, it is doctors speculate&nbsp; that it is caused by a combination of things such as genetics and environmental problems.</p>

				<p>One of the number one symptoms that people tend to experience when they are diagnosed with Crohn’s disease is extreme abdominal pain as well as cramping. There are other symptoms that your GI doctor will talk about with you such as frequent diarrhea and at times, rectal bleeding. Someone might experience the need to have frequent bowel movements as well as feeling fatigued at times. If you experience any of these symptoms and have not had a checkup yet with a doctor, you might want to make an <a href="index.php" target="_blank">appointment</a> now to have a checkup done to ensure that you do not have it or that if you do, you are able to manage the disease.</p>

				<p>There are vast numbers of people who are coping with Crohn’s disease from day to day. They often live normal lives until a flare up occurs but only because they are able to side step the symptoms. The majority of people will change their diets or skip meals or even avoid certain public places to minimize problems with this disease.</p>

				<p><strong>The side step routine may work for some but it will not cure the problem</strong>. You should ask your doctor what steps you might take to reduce the number of flare ups that you have or the steps to avoid when trying to treat the condition.</p>
