				<h1>Dr. Sridhar Goli, MD | Orlando Gastroenterology Pediatric Offering</h1>
				<hr>
				<h2>If you are looking for a children’s GI doctor in Orlando, FL, you are in the right place.</h2>
				<p>Dr. Goli, a board certified pediatric gastroenterologist, is now seeing patients. Dr. Goli delights himself in making your child’s GI experience a positive one. His trained staff puts children and parents at ease, and each staff member strives to make what my be seen as a difficult process a manageable one.</p>
				<p>He has years of experience and has been rated high on his bedside manner.</p>
				<p>If you feel, your child needs to see a doctor specializing in children’s GI problems, we can help. Before we get into our offering, let’s talk about the need for a <em>great pediatric gastroenterologist</em>.</p>
				<h3>What is Pediatric Gastroenterology?</h3>
				<p>Every kid gets a tummy ache from time to time, or has trouble pooping or may battle a bit of diarrhea. Almost all babies spit up or occasionally do the projectile vomiting thing. And we all know parents (maybe they are us) who are up day and night with a colicky infant who seems to be experiencing unrelenting pain and suffering.</p>
				<p>It’s really tough to see our kids hurt, whether from an afternoon stomach upset or from a mysterious ongoing internal ailment.<br>
				Family doctors, pediatricians, and all-night emergency care providers can usually resolve situations in which our kids have short-term stomach or abdominal pain.</p>
				<p>But what about when we suspect a deeper issue? Or when a pediatrician has exhausted his or her knowledge and experience and recognizes that a specialist needs to be called in?</p>
				<p>At that point, it’s usually a gastroenterologist that gets summoned.</p>
				<h3>How does gastroenterology differ from other fields?</h3>
				<p>Gastroenterology is the branch of medicine that deals with <strong>diseases and disorders of the digestive tract</strong>. The digestive tract includes all of the organs from the mouth to the anus.</p>
				<p>Pediatric gastroenterology deals with these disorders and diseases in infants, children, and adolescents, and the doctors who practice in this field of medicine are called pediatric gastroenterologists.<br>
				The specific organs along the gastrointestinal tract include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, gall bladder, small intestine, colon, rectum, cecum and appendix.</p>
				<h2>Pediatric Training and Fellowship</h2>
				<p>Pediatric gastroenterologists have extensive training and education. They usually have completed eight years of pre-med and medical education plus a year-long internship, three years of an internal medicine residency, and two or three years in a gastroenterology fellowship. Dr. Goli has earned the status of being board certified.</p>
				<p>In the fellowship, the doctor gets hands-on training in a demanding program that pairs him or her with an established gastroenterologist. The training GI doctor is exposed to all areas of practice, from evaluating patients to caring for them both in an office setting and in a hospital.<br>
				The fellowship training includes all aspects of endoscopy (upper endoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy) as well as endoscopic biliary examination, endoscopic ultrasounds, etc.</p>
				<p>Usually a fellowship also includes training in advanced endoscopic procedures and in reading imaging and pathology results. This training prepares the doctor to make sound recommendations for treatment of diseases and disorders.</p>
				<p>After going through a fellowship, some gastroenterologists will go on to an additional year of training in transplant hepatology, advanced endoscopy, inflammatory bowel disease, and motility.<br>
				In order to competently practice in their field, gastroenterologists must have a complete understanding of all of the involved organs and their functions. These organs all work together to facilitate healthy digestion, nutrient absorption, waste removal, and metabolic processes.</p>
				<p>In addition to understanding how the organs function and interact with each other, the gastroenterologist also must understand all of the diseases, disorders, and conditions that the various organs are subject to.<br>
				Pediatric gastroenterology teams will typically include pediatric surgeons, pediatric psychologists, pain management specialists, nurses (practitioners and registered), clinical social workers, dietitians, and pain management specialists.</p>
				<p>There are numerous conditions and disorders that pediatric patients suffer from. These are also found in adult patients suffering from digestive diseases and disorders.<br>
				However, the same conditions and disorders in pediatric patients can be more complex since organs are smaller and still developing. Also, whereas an adult patient may have a vocabulary to describe symptoms and history, a pediatric patient often does not.</p>
				<h3>What makes Children’s GI different than adult gastroenterology?</h3>
				<p>An adult patient may have established baselines in his or her history of treatment, but pediatric patients can arrive as blank slates. In these cases, the pediatric gastroenterologist relies on training, education, and experience, but is sometimes reduced to educated guesswork.</p>
				<p>Diseases, disorders, and conditions of the gastrointestinal system include abdominal pain; vomiting; Celiac disease, which is intolerance to gluten protein; swallowing disorders; constipation; short bowel syndrome; diarrhea; pancreatic disease; neonatal liver diseases, biliary tract disease (relating to the gall bladder and bile ducts), and eosinophilic esophagitis (an allergic inflammatory condition of the esophagus).</p>
				<p>More diseases and disorders include nutrition problems; failure to thrive; motility disorders (the too-slow or too-rapid movement of the stomach or intestines); feeding disorders; malabsorption disorders of the gastrointestinal tract; liver disease; gallbladder disease; intestinal obstruction and pseudo-obstruction; gastroenteritis (inflammation of the stomach and intestines); intestinal failure; gastroesophageal reflux (also known as heartburn); inflammatory bowel disease–for example, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis (a chronic disease of the colon where the lining becomes inflamed and develops open sores); gastrointestinal bleeding; gastroparesis (a stomach that can’t empty itself of food normally); gastrointestinal polyps; and gastrointestinal manifestations of cystic fibrosis.<br>
				In order to identify or address an issue or problem in a pediatric patient, a thorough physical exam is first conducted by a pediatric gastroenterologist. As part of this exam, medical and family history information is gathered, and questions asked about the child’s symptoms.</p>
				<p>After the exam and information gathering, there are a number of diagnostic procedures that can take place. These procedures may include an upper and lower endoscopy, gastric and gastroduodenal tube placement, motility studies, esophageal impedance and pH monitoring, hydrogen breath testing, intestinal biopsy, and wireless capsule endoscopy.<br>
				Of the diagnostic and treatment procedures listed above, here is a more detailed explanation of each procedure.</p>
				<p>An endoscopy will often include a colonoscopy and EGD (esophagogastroduodenoscopy). These procedures evaluate the colon, intestines, stomach, and esophagus using a very tiny scope.<br>
				Advanced therapeutic endoscopy is used in pediatric patients to control bleeding that is occurring along the gastrointestinal tract, to remove polyps, to conduct small bowel endoscopy, and to dilate or stretch areas of the bowel, colon, and esophagus that have become narrowed.</p>
				<p>Gastric and gastroduodenal tube placements are when a feeding tube is placed into the stomach via the nose or through an opening in the abdomen. Either type of feeding tube is inserted for the purpose of delivering nutrients directly to the stomach.</p>
				<p><em>Motility studies</em> assess how well the upper or lower esophageal sphincters are functioning. Usually, these studies are done by way of a catheter inserted through the nose and into the stomach. When it’s slowly drawn out, it detects and records pressure changes which enable a physician to narrow down possible problems.<br>
				Signs of a gastrointestinal motility disorder can include difficulty swallowing, heartburn, unexplained chest pain, recurring nausea and vomiting, gastroparesis, bloating, distention of the abdomen, weight loss, appetite loss, constipation, and fecal incontinence.</p>
				<p>Esophageal impedance and pH monitoring measure the amount of acid or non-acid reflux of stomach contents going into the esophagus. It’s also used for the diagnosis and treatment of acid and non-acid reflux, aspiration, croup, asthma, and rumination (the voluntary or involuntary regurgitation of partially digested food that usually occurs in babies over three months of age).<br>
				Fructose and lactose malabsorption and lactose intolerance can be identified through the use of advanced breath hydrogen testing. This test is also used to identify Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and Small Bowel Bacterial Overgrowth Syndrome (SBBOS). It’s simple and non-invasive and can be conducted at hospitals and in clinics and doctor’s offices.<br>
				In intestinal biopsies, tissue or cells are taken from the intestines and put under a microscope for examination. These help physicians determine what’s going on and what the problem issues are.</p>
				<p>Wireless capsule endoscopy provides images of the gastrointestinal tract. It is basically a tiny camera in a pill that is swallowed and then enables a doctor to see all parts of the gastrointestinal tract.<br>
				Orlando and central Florida enjoy several top-flight pediatric gastroenterology providers.<br>
				These include the Florida Children’s Center for Gastroenterology; Pediatric Gastroenterology at Nemours Children’s Hospital; Pediatric Gastroenterology at Arnold Palmer Hospital, and pediatric gastroenterologists at Florida Hospital.</p>
				<h3>Arnold Palmer Gastroenterology in Orlando</h3>
