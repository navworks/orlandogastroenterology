				<h3>Seeing the Orlando Gastroenterology Doctor For Trouble with Hemorrhoids</h3>
				
				<p><strong>At the local Orlando Gastroenterology appointment, your doctor will help you to better understand what hemorrhoids are and how you can prevent them in the future.</strong> There are some people who develop them due to pregnancy and will never get rid of them however the symptoms associated with hemorrhoids can be dealt with to make the pain and burning easier to bear. Here is some information that you can use to better understand your Orlando gastroenterology test results.</p>
				<h3>What Exactly Are Hemorrhoids?</h3>
				<p>The veins in the anal canal of your body that get swollen are known as hemorrhoids. This can be especially painful for some but in many cases is not a serious problem. The veins can cause swelling in the anal canal which forms internal hemorrhoids or you may have external hemorrhoids at the base of the anal canal. There is a chance that you can develop both at one time however.</p>
				<h3>What Causes Hemorrhoids?</h3>
				<p>When there is too much pressure on the veins in the rectal area, hemorrhoids are formed. The pelvic region as well as the rectal region will swell with pressure which leads to the formation of hemorrhoids. Typically the tissue inside of the rectum opening will fill with blood that helps to control the movements of the bowel. When you sit on the toilet too long in an attempt to remove a large portion of stool, you place more pressure on the rectum which causes the veins to swell leading to hemorrhoids.</p>
				<p>Diarrhea as well can lead to hemorrhoids since it places a strain on the anal canal. The reason pregnant women will develop them is associated with the amount of pressure placed on the anal region during the latter portion of their pregnancy due to the weight of the fluid, baby and weight gain associated with the pregnancy. The weight you gain during your pregnancy is good for your baby since it needs its nutrition but it is not as healthy for your body.</p>
				<h3>Obese or Overweight?</h3>
				<p>For someone who is overweight or obese, they can develop hemorrhoids easier as well since they have more weight and this weight is placed onto the rectum and anal cavity. If you are overweight and notice that you bleed when you go to the bathroom, this can be a sure fire sign that something is not right and that you may have hemorrhoids. Also, look for itching and pain in the rectal area as this can be associated with hemorrhoids as well.</p>
				<h3>How common are hemorrhoids?</h3>
				<p>Hemorrhoids are quite common. About half of the population will develop and experience hemorrhoids during their lifetime.</p>
				<h3>What is the treatment?</h3>
				<p>Patients can use creams and soak in warm baths to treat the symptoms of hemorrhoids and take away some of the discomfort. In order to ensure that hemorrhoids that have been treated do not recur, it is best to remember that constipation and straining are two big factors in hemorrhoids to begin with.</p>
				<p>Stay hydrated and make sure that your stool is pliable and easy to pass.</p>
				<p>Make sure that you are supplementing with fiber such as Citrucel if you are prone to a diet low in fiber.</p>
				<p>There are several types of methods used to treat hemorrhoids:</p>
				<ul>
				  <li><strong>Rubber band ligation</strong> – A rubber band is placed around the base of the hemorrhoid inside the rectum. The band cuts off circulation, and the hemorrhoid withers away within a few days.</li>
				  <li><strong>Sclerotherapy</strong> – A chemical solution is injected around the blood vessel to shrink the hemorrhoid.</li>
				  <li><strong>Infrared coagulation</strong> – A special device is used to burn hemorrhoidal tissue.</li>
				  <li><strong>Hemorrhoidectomy</strong> – Occasionally, extensive or severe internal or external hemorrhoids may require removal by surgery known as hemorrhoidectomy.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>How are hemorrhoids prevented?</h3>
				<p>Make sure you are hydrated and that you are active and healthy. By keeping stool soft, you will be able to have bowel movements more easily which will in turn put less strain on the area where hemorrhoids often develop.</p>
