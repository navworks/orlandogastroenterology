					Dr.  Pothamsetty has excellent bedside manners. He and his staff made me very comfortable from the very start about the idea of getting my colonoscopy done. I was never rushed: all my questions sweet answered to my satisfaction. The surgery center is exceptionally good: new, clean and efficient. Overall a very positive experience.

					Saturday hours at their Surgery Center are very convenient. Both my husband and myself could get our procedures done without taking days off from work. Dr. Mejia is just awesome!!

					My 8 year old daughter had quite challenging GI issues. In Dr. Goli, we have found the perfect physician: listening, caring, knowledgeable and reachable. Very happy with the services we got so far, on multiple occasions
