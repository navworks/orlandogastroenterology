					Cirrhosis 
				</h2>

				
				<p><strong>When preparing to see the Orlando Gastroenterology doctor, for cirrhosis, there are some things that you will need to know about certain questions to ask the doctor and what are the things that you can do to help with the cirrhosis.</strong></p>
				<p>Here is a list of questions that you should ask when seeking help due to cirrhosis.</p>

				<h4>What Does the Liver Do For the Body?</h4>

				<p>Your liver is going to be important for a number of reasons. One is that it helps in the clotting of your blood by transporting oxygen to your blood with proteins in it to help it to clot. It also aids in the immune system. It helps to store excess nutrients of the body and will return some of the nutrients back to your bloodstream over time. It helps in creating bile which is needed to digest food and will help in storing of sugar. It also works to rid the body of harmful bacteria that can enter the bloodstream. It will aid in breaking down saturated fats and producing cholesterol.</p>

				<h4>What Happens to the Liver When You have Cirrhosis?</h4>

				<p>Cirrhosis is a slowly progressing disease that will take a healthy liver and replace it with scar tissue. When the liver is covered in scar tissue and starts to decrease in function. The scar tissue will cause the lack of blood and will cause the slowdown of processing all the nutrients as well as hormones, drugs and other toxins to be processed. It can also cause the slowdown of the production of the proteins as well as other substances.</p>

				<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is the 12<sup>th</sup> other leading cause of death according to the National Institute of Health.</span></p>

				<p>There are many causes of Cirrhosis of the liver including obesity as well as diabetes. There are chronic viral infections where the liver is infected such as Hepatitis B,C, and D however D is very rare. The blockage of the bile duct that will carry bile from the liver to the intestine can also cause Cirrhosis. Someone who suffers from chronic heart failure can also develop Cirrhosis due to the fluids backing up and the liver being overwhelmed with fluid. There are also certain inherited diseases that can cause or contribute to cirrhosis such as cystic fibrosis and glycogen storage diseases.</p>

				<p><em>Some people will develop Cirrhosis from other factors such as prescriptions and prolonged exposure to certain elements or infections.</em></p>
				<p>It is important to be under the care of a skilled gastroenterologist. Orlando Gastroenterology is well versed in helping patients suffering from Cirrhosis. Schedule an appointment for a friendly, sympathetic evaluation with our team of highly trained professionals.</p>
